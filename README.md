<h1>Hello and Welcome to Thomas Hopkins' Portfolio Repository!</h1>
<p>If you are here and have not seen my actual <a href="https://whopkinsthomas.netlify.app">portfolio</a>, I recommend you go there first to see more of the work I have done throughout my career.</p>
<h2>About the Site</h2>
<p>This repository and site are forked from <a href="https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio">saadpasta's DeveloperFolio</a>, but many parts of the site have been modified to better fit my needs. The site is built using the JavaScript framework <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> and hosted and deployed via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify.</p>
